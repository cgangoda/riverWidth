# riverWidth
Objective of this project is to convert and derive river width code in python. The develoments document here are based on Yang et al (2020) and Pavelsky & Smith (2008). More descriptions will be added later...
The scientific hypothesis is quite simple here that the repeated RIVER WIDTH measurements help improve the RIVER DISCHARGES estimations at the river reach scale.
