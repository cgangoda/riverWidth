# riverWidth
Objective of this project is to convert/use existing non-python codes into python code base to compute river widths. 

The develoments given here are currently based on Yang et al (2020) and Pavelsky & Smith (2008). More descriptions will be added later...

The scientific hypothesis is quite simple here that the repeated RIVER WIDTH measurements help improve the RIVER DISCHARGES estimations at the river reach scale.

Many satellite-based river discharge estimation methods use river width observation as an input to their modeling platforms.

River width measurements will help us monitor millions of ungauged river reaches worldwide with the help of the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission.
